    suggestions:
      use_new_episodes: |
        You can use the :new_episodes record mode to allow VCR to
        record this new request to the existing cassette

      delete_cassette_for_once: |
        The current record mode (:once) does not allow new requests to be recorded
        to a previously recorded cassette. You can delete the cassette file and re-run
        your tests to allow the cassette to be recorded with this request

      deal_with_none: |
        The current record mode (:none) does not allow requests to be recorded. You
        can temporarily change the record mode to :once, delete the cassette file 
        and re-run your tests to allow the cassette to be recorded with this request

      use_a_cassette: |
        If you want VCR to record this request and play it back during future test
        runs, you should wrap your test (or this portion of your test) in a
        `VCR.use_cassette` block

      allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette: |
        If you only want VCR to handle requests made while a cassette is in use,
        configure `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette = true`. VCR will
        ignore this request since it is made when there is no cassette

      ignore_request: |
        If you want VCR to ignore this request (and others like it), you can
        set an `ignore_request` callback

      allow_playback_repeats: |
        The cassette contains an HTTP interaction that matches this request,
        but it has already been played back. If you wish to allow a single HTTP
        interaction to be played back multiple times, set the `:allow_playback_repeats`
        cassette option

      match_requests_on: |
        Some interractions haven't played back. 
        If your request is non-deterministic, you may need to
        change your :match_requests_on cassette option to be more lenient
        or use a custom request matcher to allow it to match

      try_debug_logger: |
        If you're surprised VCR is raising this error
        and want insight about how VCR attempted to handle the request,
        you can use the debug_logger configuration option to log more details
